        <h1>USA</h1>
        The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country
        comprising 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions.[h] At
        3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), the United States is the world's third or fourth largest country by
        total area[d] and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe's 3.9 million square miles (10.1
        million km2). With a population of more than 327 million people, the U.S. is the third most populous country.
        The capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New York City. Forty-eight states and the
        capital's federal district are contiguous in North America between Canada and Mexico. The State of Alaska is in
        the northwest corner of North America, bordered by Canada to the east and across the Bering Strait from Russia
        to the west. The State of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The U.S. territories are scattered
        about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, stretching across nine official time zones. The extremely diverse
        geography, climate, and wildlife of the United States make it one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries.[22]

        Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago.[23] European
        colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established
        along the East Coast. Following the French and Indian War, numerous disputes between Great Britain and the
        colonies led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775, and the subsequent Declaration of Independence in
        1776. The war ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a
        European power.[24] The current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively
        named the Bill of Rights, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. The United
        States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, acquiring new
        territories,[25] displacing Native American tribes, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the
        continent by 1848.[25]

        During the second half of the 19th century, the Civil War led to the abolition of slavery.[26][27] By the end of
        the century, the United States had extended into the Pacific Ocean,[28] and its economy, driven in large part by
        the Industrial Revolution, began to soar.[29] The Spanishâ€“American War and World War I confirmed the country's
        status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first
        country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the
        United Nations Security Council. Sweeping civil rights legislation, notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the
        Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, outlawed discrimination based on race or color.
        During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race, culminating with the
        1969 U.S. Moon landing. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United
        States as the world's sole superpower.[30]

        A multicultural country, the United States is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a federal republic
        and a representative democracy. The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank,
        International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), and other international organizations. The
        United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest
        economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP.[31] The U.S. economy is largely
        post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities, although the
        manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world.[32] The United States is the world's largest
        importer and the second largest exporter of goods, by value.[33][34] Although its population is only 4.3% of the
        world total,[35] the U.S. holds 31% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth
        concentrated in a single country.[36]

        Despite income and wealth disparities, the United States continues to rank very high in measures of
        socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and worker
        productivity.[37][38] The United States is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third of global
        military spending,[39] and is a leading political, cultural, and scientific force internationally.[40]
