        Geography (from Greek: γεωγραφία, geographia, literally "earth description")[1] is a field of science devoted to
        the
        study of the lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena of the Earth and planets.[2] The first person to use
        the
        word γεωγραφία was Eratosthenes (276–194 BC).[3] Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an
        understanding of Earth and its human and natural complexities—not merely where objects are, but also how they
        have
        changed and come to be.

        Geography is often defined in terms of two branches: human geography and physical geography.[4][5] Human
        geography
        deals with the study of people and their communities, cultures, economies, and interactions with the environment
        by
        studying their relations with and across space and place.[6] Physical geography deals with the study of
        processes
        and patterns in the natural environment like the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere.

        The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human
        phenomena,
        area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences.[7] Geography
        has
        been called "the world discipline"[8] and "the bridge between the human and the physical sciences".[9]
